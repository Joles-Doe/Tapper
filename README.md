# Tapper C++
I wanted to try and create a game engine that uses SDL. I needed a game to make alongside it, so I decided on tapper. For this particular program, I was more focused on the programming side rather than the design side (definitely not because my design direction was a mess), so the assets used don't particularly match with one another.
